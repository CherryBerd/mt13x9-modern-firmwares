# About the repository with modified firmware (and their archives)
Modified firmware for DVD players based on MediaTek MT1369/1379/1389 chips will be posted here.
# Warning!!!
Before testing the performance of the player with modified firmware, it is necessary to reflash via data cable with a programmer on the MAX232 chip, or try to rename the firmware file to "MTK.BIN" and burn it to a blank and empty CD.
**Be careful with this, the player may permanently break after flashing incorrectly. The author is not responsible for a broken and corrupted device **
